# üéØ Confidence Scoring System for E/M Code Auditing

## Overview
The confidence scoring system provides a standardized way to assess the reliability of E/M code assignments based on documentation quality and clinical evidence.

## üìä Confidence Tiers

### üü¢ Very High (90-100 points)
**Label:** `Very High`  
**Color:** Green  
**Description:** Clear, unambiguous documentation fully supports the assigned code with robust clinical evidence

**Characteristics:**
- ‚úÖ All required elements clearly documented
- ‚úÖ Medical Decision Making thoroughly detailed
- ‚úÖ Time documentation present (if time-based)
- ‚úÖ Medical necessity clearly established
- ‚úÖ No ambiguous language or missing components
- ‚úÖ Strong correlation between clinical complexity and assigned code

**UI Indicators:**
- Display as "Very High Confidence"
- Use green color scheme

---

### üîµ High (70-89 points)
**Label:** `High`  
**Color:** Blue  
**Description:** Good documentation supports the code with minor gaps or ambiguities

**Characteristics:**
- ‚úÖ Most required elements present
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor gaps in documentation
- ‚úÖ Medical Decision Making adequately described
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some areas could benefit from clarification
- ‚úÖ Code assignment well-justified overall

**UI Indicators:**
- Display as "High Confidence"
- Use blue color scheme

---

### üü° Moderate (50-69 points)
**Label:** `Moderate`  
**Color:** Yellow/Orange  
**Description:** Reasonable support for the code but some uncertainties or missing elements

**Characteristics:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some required elements missing or unclear
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Medical Decision Making partially documented
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Borderline between two code levels
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Additional clarification would strengthen the case
- ‚úÖ Basic medical necessity established

**UI Indicators:**
- Display as "Moderate Confidence"
- Use yellow/orange color scheme

---

### üü† Low (30-49 points)
**Label:** `Low`  
**Color:** Orange/Red  
**Description:** Limited support, significant gaps, or borderline between codes

**Characteristics:**
- ‚ùå Multiple required elements missing
- ‚ùå Medical Decision Making poorly documented
- ‚ùå Significant ambiguity in code assignment
- ‚ùå Risk of compliance issues
- ‚ö†Ô∏è May require additional documentation

**UI Indicators:**
- Display as "Low Confidence"
- Use orange/red color scheme

---

### üî¥ Very Low (0-29 points)
**Label:** `Very Low`  
**Color:** Red  
**Description:** Poor documentation, major gaps, or conflicting evidence

**Characteristics:**
- ‚ùå Critical elements missing or contradictory
- ‚ùå Medical Decision Making inadequate
- ‚ùå High compliance risk
- ‚ùå Code assignment questionable
- ‚ùå Substantial documentation improvements needed

**UI Indicators:**
- Display as "Very Low Confidence"
- Use red color scheme

## üèóÔ∏è Confidence Object Structure

```json
{
  "confidence": {
    "score": 85,
    "tier": "High",
    "reasoning": "FACTORS INCREASING CONFIDENCE:\n- Clear medical decision making documented\n- Patient history thoroughly detailed\n- Physical examination findings well-documented\n\nFACTORS DECREASING CONFIDENCE:\n- Time documentation not explicitly stated\n- Some diagnostic test results mentioned but not detailed",
    "score_deductions": [
      "- Score reduced by 10 points: Time spent with patient not documented",
      "- Score reduced by 5 points: Laboratory results mentioned but values not specified"
    ]
  }
}
```

## üé® UI/UX Implementation Guidelines

### Visual Indicators
- **Progress Bars:** Use color-coded progress bars to show confidence score
- **Icons:** Include tier-specific icons (checkmark, warning, error)
- **Badges:** Display confidence tier as colored badges
- **Charts:** Use radial progress indicators for dashboard views

### Interaction Patterns
- **Hover Details:** Show score breakdown on hover
- **Expandable Sections:** Allow users to expand detailed reasoning
- **Filter Options:** Enable filtering by confidence tier
- **Sort Capabilities:** Allow sorting by confidence score

### Workflow Integration
- **Auto-Approval:** Very High confidence cases can auto-approve
- **Review Queues:** Route Low/Very Low confidence cases to supervisors
- **Alerts:** Set up notifications for confidence drops below thresholds
- **Reporting:** Generate confidence trend reports for quality improvement

## üìà Score Calculation Guidelines

### Base Score Starts at 100
Deduct points for:
- **Missing MDM elements:** -10 to -20 points each
- **Unclear time documentation:** -5 to -15 points
- **Ambiguous medical necessity:** -10 to -25 points
- **Missing physical exam details:** -5 to -15 points
- **Incomplete history:** -5 to -10 points
- **Coding justification gaps:** -10 to -20 points

### Minimum Thresholds
- **90+ points:** All critical elements present, minor clarifications only
- **70+ points:** Most elements present, some gaps acceptable
- **50+ points:** Basic requirements met, notable deficiencies
- **30+ points:** Significant gaps, compliance concerns
- **Below 30:** Major deficiencies, high audit risk
