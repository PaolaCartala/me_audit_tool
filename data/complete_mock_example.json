[cite: 1] [cite_start]She has a history of severe osteoarthritis with bone-on-bone changes confirmed on imaging. [cite: 1] [cite_start]She underwent a successful right total hip arthroplasty (12/6/2024) and reports good function on that side. [cite: 1] [cite_start]However, the left hip continues to cause significant stiffness and pain, radiating into the thigh and posterior hip, aggravated by ambulation and partially relieved with rest. [cite: 1] [cite_start]Pain disrupts sleep and limits daily activities. [cite: 1] [cite_start]The patient has tried multiple conservative measures including weight loss (volitional loss of ~70 lbs), activity modification, analgesics, NSAIDs, and physical therapy without sufficient relief. [cite: 1] [cite_start]She has also undergone bilateral knee radiofrequency ablations (2022) with some improvement, but her knees remain arthritic and symptomatic. [cite: 1] [cite_start]She is motivated to proceed with left total hip arthroplasty to improve mobility and function. [cite: 1] [cite_start]Recent hospitalization (July 23-August 15, 2025) at Henry Ford/Harbor Oaks was for management of bipolar disorder type II, with adjustment of psychiatric medications. [cite: 1] [cite_start]She required a walker during admission due to hip pain. [cite: 1] [cite_start]She currently weighs ~220 lbs (BMI ~30, down from BMI 39).
