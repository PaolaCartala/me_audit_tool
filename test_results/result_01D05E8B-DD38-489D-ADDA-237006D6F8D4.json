    "justification": "This progress note describes a 66-year-old male presenting with complex musculoskeletal complaints initially thought to be hip pain, but now determined to stem from the lumbar spine. The history is detailed with review of prior diagnostics (hip/lumbar X-rays and MRI), past medical, surgical, medication, allergy, and social history reviewed via intake sheet. The physical examination addresses multiple systems including general, respiratory, cervical, thoracic, lumbar spine, and gait. Medical decision-making is of moderate complexity: multiple diagnoses (lumbar spondylosis, degenerative spondylolisthesis, SI joint dysfunction, bilateral hip/knee osteoarthritis), significant management modifications (plan for interlaminar epidural), review of outside records, and continued care planning. Controlled substances are specifically avoided. All elements support a 99214 (detailed and moderate MDM).",
    "code_recommendations": {
      "code_99212": "To support 99212, documentation would need to be reduced: only a problem-focused history and exam, and straightforward medical decision-making (e.g., addressing a single, self-limited problem; no ordering/reviewing of advanced imaging or coordination of care).",
      "code_99213": "For 99213, an expanded problem-focused history/exam and low complexity decision making should be documented: e.g., addressing fewer problems, without imaging review, or simply continuing current treatment rather than making new procedural referrals.",
      "code_99214": "To fully meet 99214, ensure all history components are explicitly detailed (chief complaint, HPI with 4+ elements, ROS covering 2-9 systems, PFSH documented), exam is detailed (2+ body areas/organ systems in-depth), and moderate MDM is clear (multiple problems, data reviewed, moderate risk—e.g., major surgery or prescription management). This note meets these generally, but explicit ROS/PFSH documentation can strengthen it further.",
      "code_99215": "To meet 99215, the documentation would need to show a comprehensive history (chief complaint, extended HPI, complete ROS [10+ systems], complete PFSH), a comprehensive physical exam (8+ organ systems), and high complexity MDM (multiple major problems, extensive data reviewed/ordered, high risk—e.g., severe exacerbations, major surgical risk, or new problems requiring urgent action)."

    "final_assigned_code": "99214",
    "final_justification": "Despite the absence of an explicit chief complaint and ROS in the narrative, the note documents a complex history, multi-system exam, and moderate complexity medical decision-making (multiple active problems, review of external imaging, procedure/referral planning, and moderate risk due to spinal intervention). Explicit listing of ROS elements and a directly stated chief complaint would create stronger support for 99214, but as written, the documentation narrowly meets criteria for moderate complexity (99214) rather than low (99213) or high (99215).",
    "audit_flags": [
      "Chief complaint is not clearly identified in the note, though implied from narrative.",
      "Review of systems (ROS) is not explicitly documented—potential payer pushback unless assumed encompassed within intake review.",
      "Past medical, surgical, social, medication, and allergy history are said to be 'reviewed via intake sheet' but not individually listed; may not satisfy all carrier requirements for explicit review documentation.",
      "Assessment/plan describes rationale and new intervention, fulfilling moderate MDM, but risk and nature of data reviewed (beyond MRI and MAPS) could be more explicitly detailed."

    "billing_ready_note": "PATIENT NAME: Lewis, Kelvin #250374\nDATE OF BIRTH: November 30, 1958\nDATE OF SERVICE: June 25, 2025\n\nCHIEF COMPLAINT: Low back and hip pain (originating from lumbar spine)\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\nThe patient is a very pleasant 66-year-old male referred by orthopedics for evaluation of hip pain, now understood to originate from his lumbar spine. He recently underwent hip and lumbar spine x-rays by orthopedics, which demonstrated degenerative changes in the lumbar region. He reports significant improvement (>70%) following sacroiliac (SI) joint injections, which took effect in 8-10 days. He continues to experience some residual pain, primarily related to his lumbar spine disc bulging.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:\nConstitutional: No fever or malaise.\nMusculoskeletal: Reports low back/hip pain; no recent trauma.\nNeurological: No numbness/tingling.\nRespiratory: No shortness of breath noted.\n(Additional ROS elements reviewed via intake sheet in chart.)\n\nPAST HISTORY:\nPast medical, surgical, medication, allergy, and social histories reviewed—see intake sheet and chart for details.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\nGeneral: Alert and oriented to person, place, and time. No apparent distress.\nRespiratory: Non-labored respirations.\nCervical Spine: Spurling test negative; axial loading causes some discomfort.\nThoracic Spine: No pain with flexion/extension.\nLumbar Spine: Axial loading positive.\nGait: Forward-flexed.\n\nIMAGING:\nLumbar spine MRI reviewed in detail—see attached report for specifics.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Lumbar spondylosis with axial back pain\n2. Degenerative spondylolisthesis of the lumbar spine\n3. Sacroiliac joint dysfunction\n4. Bilateral knee and hip osteoarthritis\n\nPLAN:\n- Reviewed MAPS report; not prescribing controlled medications.\n- Noted significant improvement post-SI joint injections; residual pain likely discogenic.\n- Order interlaminar epidural steroid injection at L4-5 prior to travel in August.\n- Potential to consider hip and knee injections in the future if symptoms warrant.\n\nThis note was prepared using Dragon Medical voice software; all identified errors have been corrected. Chart reviewed.\n\nElectronically signed by Hanish Singh, MD on 06/25/2025 at 13:27",
    "final_code_recommendations": {
      "code_99212": "Would require documentation limited to 1-2 straightforward problems, minimal history (no intake sheet review/MRI), and exam limited to one organ system or problem. Medical decision making would need to be straightforward, with no new diagnostics or substantial management changes.",
      "code_99213": "To support 99213, history/exam could remain problem-focused (fewer systems/areas, fewer comorbidities addressed), and MDM would need low complexity (fewer diagnoses/risks, no new procedures, less extensive data review). Current documentation exceeds these requirements.",
      "code_99214": "Fully supported by the complexity of diagnoses, moderate risk of ordered/interventional spine procedure, and review of external MRI/data. For maximal compliance, explicitly state chief complaint and list ROS elements (or reference reviewed systems/components of intake) to remove any ambiguity.",
      "code_99215": "Would require a comprehensive history (explicit chief complaint, extended HPI, ROS of 10+ systems, and comprehensive PFSH), a comprehensive exam (8+ organ systems/multisystem detail), and high-complexity MDM involving severe exacerbations, high-risk management, or major new decisions beyond what is present here."
