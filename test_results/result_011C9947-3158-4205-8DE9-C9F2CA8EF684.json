    "justification": "This is a post-operative follow-up via telehealth for a recent right total knee arthroplasty. The visit includes a focused history with clear documentation of the reason for the visit (follow-up after surgery, pain management, bleeding assessment), current medications, and review of recent complications (post-op bleeding, currently resolved). Examination is deferred due to the telehealth format. The medical decision making (MDM) is consistent with low complexity: there are two problems—acute post-op pain and resolved post-op bleeding while on anticoagulation—that are stable or improving; medication management including a controlled substance prescription and counseling on weaning; and ongoing monitoring for bleeding complications. This is most consistent with 99213 (expanded problem focused, low MDM). No moderate/high risk interventions or new acute problems justify a higher code, and documentation exceeds the threshold for a 99212.",
    "code_recommendations": {
      "code_99212": "To bill 99212, documentation could be limited to a very simple complaint (e.g., only confirming that post-op recovery is going without complication, no medication changes, no active issues except stable post-op pain, and no significant risk factors addressed or managed). MDM must be straightforward.",
      "code_99213": "Current documentation meets criteria for 99213: expanded problem focused history (chief complaint, brief HPI, some ROS through history), and low MDM (acute/uncomplicated post-op pain, resolved bleeding, simple medication management).",
      "code_99214": "To support 99214, the note would need a detailed history (more complete HPI, at least 2-9 ROS, and 1-2 PFSH), and especially moderate complexity MDM. This might include identification and management of new post-op complications (e.g., active or recurrent bleeding, possible infection), interpretation of diagnostic tests, more extensive counseling, or acute complexity in pain management (e.g., evaluating non-response to current medications or managing side effects/adverse events).",
      "code_99215": "To justify 99215, the visit would require a comprehensive history and examination (if possible via telehealth), multiple serious problems with high risk (e.g., active bleeding requiring urgent intervention, suspected DVT/PE, significant adverse drug reactions, or multi-drug management for high-risk medication), and complex decision making, potentially including coordination with other providers, urgent diagnostic work-up, or hospital admission considerations."

    "final_assigned_code": "99213",
    "final_justification": "The documentation supports CPT 99213 based on a problem-focused history, low complexity MDM, and appropriate telehealth exam deferral. Two stable/improving post-op issues are addressed, and medication management is documented, including controlled substance counseling. There is no active complication or moderate/high risk complexity to support 99214 or above. Documentation exceeds 99212 requirements with clear justification for 99213. For higher-level coding (99214+), more comprehensive documentation in history, ROS, exam (if possible), and demonstrably increased complexity/risk are required.",
    "audit_flags": [
      "Physical examination deferred as allowed for telehealth but not documented as reviewed by observation or patient report, which can strengthen telehealth compliance.",
      "Review of systems (ROS) minimally documented—additional specific ROS elements (e.g., constitutional, musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, hematologic/bleeding) would strengthen history support for higher codes.",
      "History of present illness (HPI) is brief—generally sufficient for 99213, but additional context (pain features, bleeding severity, response to therapy) would help justify higher MDM if needed.",
      "Counseling on Norco usage is present, but more detailed documentation of risk/benefit discussion and medication monitoring may further support MDM complexity for higher codes.",
      "Plan references review of 'maps' without explicit statement that it refers to controlled substance monitoring (MAPS/PMP) which would clarify medical decision making."

She remains on Eliquis for DVT prophylaxis and reports a minor bleeding episode over the weekend, now resolved. Pain remains controlled with Norco 5-325 mg q4h as prescribed, and Celebrex is used as adjunct. Requests Norco refill. No new complaints or signs of infection.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:\n- Constitutional: No fever or chills.\n- Musculoskeletal: Post-op knee pain present, no swelling or redness.\n- Hematologic: No further bleeding episodes.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM (TELEHEALTH):\nExam deferred due to virtual visit; patient states surgical wound appears as expected and is ambulating for therapy as instructed.\n\nASSESSMENT:\n1. Acute post-op pain, R TKA, improving\n2. Acute post-op bleeding, on Eliquis, now resolved\n3. Status post right total knee arthroplasty 6/16/2025\n\nPLAN:\n- Bleeding episode resolved; continue Eliquis as previously directed. Continue PT as prescribed.\n- Refill Norco, maximum as prescribed for acute pain. Discussed weaning plan and risks of ongoing opioid use. Patient instructed to supplement Tylenol/anti-inflammatories as needed.\n- MAPS (prescription monitoring) reviewed and appropriate.\n- Routine post-op follow-up scheduled next week.\n\nDictation prepared via Dragon Medical software.

    "final_code_recommendations": {
      "code_99212": "Appropriate if visit solely confirms post-op stability with no medication management, new issues, or risk factors addressed. Consider reducing note to simply postoperative check-in, with no active management required.",
      "code_99213": "Meets criteria as documented: expanded problem-focused history, low MDM (resolved post-op bleeding, uncomplicated pain), medication review/refill. Consider improving future notes with explicit brief ROS and noting review of medication monitoring (MAPS/PMP) for clarity.",
      "code_99214": "Requires more detailed history (expanded HPI with specifics on pain, bleeding, therapy; 2+ ROS; PFSH), moderate complexity MDM such as active complication (e.g., ongoing or recurrent bleeding), new problem evaluation, or extensive medication adjustments/counseling. Consider additional patient education or risk-benefit documentation for controlled substances.",
      "code_99215": "Would need comprehensive history and exam, multiple severe new problems, high risk, and complex coordination or urgent intervention. Not supported by this visit."
