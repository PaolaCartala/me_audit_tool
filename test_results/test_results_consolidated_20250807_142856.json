Some issues with medications.\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\nPatient is doing okay. Has some complaints. Taking medications most of the time. Blood pressure seems fine. Sugar levels variable. Had some tests done recently but results not available yet. Patient reports feeling tired sometimes. No major complaints today.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\nDiabetes and high blood pressure. Maybe some other things.\nMEDICATIONS:\nPatient takes several medications. Details not available at this time.\nALLERGIES:\nPatient mentions something about allergies but not sure what exactly.\nSOCIAL HISTORY:\nOccasional smoker. Social drinking.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\nVital Signs:\nBP elevated, other vitals stable\nGeneral:\nPatient appears well\nOther systems:\nExamination largely normal\nASSESSMENT:\n1. Diabetes - continue management\n2. Hypertension - adjust as needed\n3. Patient education provided\nPLAN:\nContinue current medications. Follow up as needed. Patient to call if problems. Will review test results when available.\nThis dictation was prepared using Dragon Medical voice recognition software.  As a result, errors may occur.  When identified, these errors have been corrected.  While every attempt is made to correct errors during dictation, errors may still exist.",

        "justification": "Based on the provided documentation and 2025 AMA guidelines, CPT code 99213 (Established Patient Office or Other Outpatient Visit - Low MDM or 20-29 minutes) is most appropriate. The patient presents for follow-up of two chronic stable conditions (diabetes and hypertension) with variable control but no acute exacerbation. Data reviewed/analyzed are limited (recent tests ordered, but results are absent; no independent interpretation or external communication indicated), and risk is low (continued medication management with no changes documented; no new prescriptions or interventions). The physical exam and history are medically appropriate for the problems addressed. There is no evidence of moderate or high complexity issues (such as exacerbation/progression, new undiagnosed problems, or acute injury/illness with systemic symptoms). The plan involves routine follow-up, continuation of current therapy, and review of labs when available. Thus, the note supports Low MDM, justifying code 99213 per AMA requirements.",

          "code_99214": "- Indicate evidence of moderate complexity: one or more chronic illnesses with exacerbation, progression, or side effects, two or more stable chronic illnesses, an undiagnosed new problem with uncertain prognosis, or an acute complicated injury/illness\n- Demonstrate moderate or greater data complexity (review/order of three or more unique tests/documents, independent interpretation, or discussion with an outside doctor/QHP)\n- Explicitly document prescription drug management, change in therapy, or moderate risk procedures/interventions\n- Detail any functional or social consequences impacting care (e.g., impact on activities of daily living, limitations due to disease, etc.)\n- Add changes or challenges in management such as medication changes, significant counseling, or indications for future advanced diagnostics",
          "code_99215": "- Document severe exacerbation or progression of a chronic illness or an acute problem posing threat to life or limb\n- Detail extensive data review from multiple sources (3+): review of outside records, multiple unique tests, independent test interpretation, discussions with multiple providers\n- Clarify high risk management (e.g., decision for hospital admission, major surgery, or intensive monitoring for toxicity)\n- Note any decision-making around high-risk medication adjustments or emergency interventions\n- Capture any new/worsening symptoms that indicate threat to life/bodily function and the related actions taken"

Problems addressed include two chronic conditions (diabetes and hypertension) which are mentioned as being under ongoing management with no acute exacerbation or complication. Data reviewed/analyzed is limited: the only reference is to tests recently done (unspecified), with no detailed review or ordering directly described. Risk is low: the plan is continuation of current regimen with no changes, and there is no indication of prescription drug management or interventions implying moderate risk. There is no evidence of higher complexity as required for 99214 or 99215. All elements align with Low MDM as defined by the 2025 AMA guidelines.",
