    "justification": "The progress note documents a problem-focused history (chief complaint: subungual abscess of right hallux with pain), and the examination/procedure includes evaluation and treatment (incision and drainage, nail debridement, pus expression, removal of infected tissue, wound care). While the history and exam are more focused, the medical decision making (MDM) is low complexity: a single acute, uncomplicated illness or injury was addressed, a minor surgical procedure was performed in the office, and the patient was given wound care instructions with a short follow-up planned. The MDM does not meet moderate or high complexity, as there is no evidence of systemic symptoms, underlying comorbidity management, or extensive data review. This reflects 99213: expanded problem focused history/exam, low MDM.",
    "code_recommendations": {
      "code_99212": "To justify 99212 (problem focused visit, straightforward MDM), the documentation could be briefer: only brief HPI/chief complaint, a very limited exam focused just on the affected toe, and medical decision making reflecting a minor problem with minimal risk. The current note exceeds this standard by documenting a minor procedure and detailed wound care.",
      "code_99213": "For 99213 (assigned code): The existing documentation is appropriate—expanded problem focused history, focused physical exam and low complexity MDM for a straightforward minor surgical intervention, with aftercare instructions.",
      "code_99214": "To justify 99214 (detailed visit, moderate MDM), additional information would be required, such as a more detailed history (including an extended ROS and PFSH), a more comprehensive examination, and moderate-complexity decision making. This could include discussion of significant comorbidities, management of systemic symptoms or complications (e.g., cellulitis or sepsis risk), extensive data review, or coordination of care (consults, labs, cultures, or imaging).",
      "code_99215": "To justify 99215 (comprehensive visit, high MDM), documentation would need to include a comprehensive history (complete HPI, ROS, and PFSH), comprehensive exam, and high complexity MDM. This could include management of severe or life-threatening infections, multisystem involvement, high risk of morbidity, intensive data review, or the initiation of IV antibiotics and hospital admission."

    "final_justification": "Despite focused documentation, the visit addresses an acute complaint requiring an in-office minor procedure (incision and drainage), aftercare planning, and patient instructions. The medical decision making is low complexity (one acute, uncomplicated problem; minor procedure; low risk). Documentation does not support moderate or high complexity MDM (99214/99215), nor is it limited enough for only 99212. However, the lack of robust history and exam documentation means this code is only justifiable if the practitioner’s intent to address more than the procedure is established—with modifier 25 if billed concurrently with 10160.",

      "Lack of documented history of present illness (HPI), review of systems (ROS), or past medical/family/social history (PFSH)—minimal history is present with only diagnosis/complaint.",
      "Physical examination details are missing; only procedural details are included without objective findings or vital signs.",
      "Procedure (incision and drainage, debridement) should be reported separately (CPT 10160); E/M code may require modifier 25 if billed concurrently.",

No fever, chills, or evidence of systemic symptoms. No prior similar episodes reported.\n\nRelevant Past Medical History: [Not documented – please add if available]\nAllergies: [Not documented – please add if available]\nMedications: [Not documented – please add if available]\n\nReview of Systems (pertinent): Negative for fever/chills. Rest of review unremarkable as per patient.\n\nPhysical Examination:\nGeneral: Patient alert and oriented, in no acute distress.\nRight hallux: Erythema, swelling, tenderness. Fluctuance noted beneath the nail bed. No evidence of spreading cellulitis. Vital signs [not documented – please add if available].\n\nAssessment: Subungual abscess, right hallux.\n\nPlan:\n- Nail plate debrided to expose subungual abscess. Area cleansed with Vashe solution. Abscess incised with #15 blade and pus expressed. Infected tissue excised. Site irrigated and dressed with antibiotic. Patient instructed to keep dressing dry and clean, and to return for wound check/removal in 3 days.\n- Patient advised on signs of worsening infection/cellulitis and to seek care if symptoms worsen.\n\nProcedure: Incision and drainage of subungual abscess performed in office (CPT 10160).\n\n[If E/M code billed with procedure, use modifier 25 and ensure medical necessity justification is present.]\n\nProvider: Fred B.

      "code_99214": "Would require documentation of an extended HPI, ROS, and PFSH, more detailed physical exam, and demonstration of moderate complexity MDM—consideration of complicating factors (comorbidities, risk of cellulitis, advanced wound care, etc.) is absent.",
