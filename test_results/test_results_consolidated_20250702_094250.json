        "justification": "The documentation supports E/M code 99213 (Expanded problem focused history and exam, low complexity MDM). The note includes a chief complaint (painful overgrown fungal nails and ingrown nail), brief HPI (pain, risk factors, limitation with walking), and elements of ROS and exam (integument, vascular, nails, neuro, MSK). The MDM involves addressing two problems (fungal nails—stable, chronic, but painful, and acute ingrown nail), one of which led to a procedure (partial avulsion). The risks associated with these procedures and patient conditions indicate low (bordering on moderate) complexity, but given the absence of detailed data review, multiple comorbidities, or significant management options, 99213 is most appropriate. No significant new diagnoses, management of serious comorbid conditions, or high-risk data/decision-making is present to support higher levels.",

          "code_99212": "Would need documentation limited to a straightforward problem (e.g., a single symptomatic nail or mild fungal change), with a very brief history (chief complaint, 1-3 HPI elements), a limited (single system) exam, and simple decision-making without procedural considerations or risk factors. No significant comorbidities or procedures indicated.",
          "code_99213": "Documentation currently matches this level: expanded problem focused history and exam, low complexity MDM. To further solidify, provider could clarify elements of PFSH and specific ROS reviewed, as well as clear risk stratification. Continued documentation of multiple symptoms or minor procedures is sufficient.",
          "code_99214": "To support 99214, need a more detailed history (extended HPI, ROS, and PFSH), a more detailed examination involving multiple body systems or more detailed abnormal findings, and at least moderate complexity decision making: e.g., extensive data review, management/change of chronic comorbid illnesses, or significant risk such as systemic infection, failure of prior therapy, need for prescription medication, or risk of complications. More detailed risk assessment (significant functional limitation, multiple comorbidities affecting management choices) would help.",
          "code_99215": "Would need a comprehensive history (complete HPI, 10+ ROS, full PFSH), comprehensive multi-system exam, and high complexity decision making—which includes acute or chronic conditions posing a threat to life or limb, dramatic functional compromise, extensive data review/ordering (labs, imaging), or coordination with other care providers. Significant comorbidities, management dilemmas, or new or sudden severe symptoms/complications would be necessary."

There is no clear discussion of systemic factors, complex comorbidity management, or high-risk decision-making. Documentation best supports 99213.

Risk factors were reviewed and include chronic nail pathology requiring medical treatment. He reports new increased pain and redness along the right great toenail medial border, suggestive of an acute ingrown nail. No fevers or systemic symptoms reported.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:\n- Integument: Positive for painful overgrown toenails, local redness, and swelling. Denies skin infection or fever.\nAdditional systems reviewed and negative except as noted above.\n\nPAST MEDICAL/SOCIAL/FAMILY HISTORY:\n- No diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, or known immunosuppression documented. (Consider adding this section if information is available in medical record.)\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\n- Integument: Callous lesions not specifically noted; skin overlying right hallux medial nail border is erythematous and tender, localized swelling without drainage or ascending infection.\n- Vascular: Pulses present, capillary fill time normal, no varicosities, normal temperature.\n- Nails: Thick, dark, dystrophic nails with debris, >2mm thickness, irregular pattern. Ingrown nail present at right hallux medial border, pain with palpation.\n- Neurological: Reflexes normal, protective sensation intact via SWMF wire.\n- MSK: Mild pes planus.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Painful overgrown fungal nails\n2. Ingrown right hallux nail\n\nPLAN:\n1. Debridement of multiple fungal toenails (CPT 11721): Nails debrided to healthy pink tissue with subungual debris and necrotic tissue removed, performed using nail nippers and dremel.\n2. Partial nail avulsion right hallux medial border (CPT 11730): After digital block with 1-3cc 1% lidocaine plain, alcohol prep, removal of offending nail border proximal to eponychium performed. Ointment and dry dressing applied. Home care instructions given.\n3. Follow up as needed. Patient instructed to monitor for signs of infection (redness, pus, fever) and to call if symptoms worsen.\n\nElectronically Signed By: Leff, Fred B DPM, Date: June 25, 2025 8:36 PM",

        "justification": "The visit is a follow-up postoperative telehealth encounter following right total knee arthroplasty. The patient's chief complaints involve postoperative pain management and a history of recent bleeding on Eliquis, now resolved. The documentation includes a brief review of history, medication management (including discussion and refills for Norco, anti-inflammatory management, ongoing Eliquis use, and follow-up physical therapy instructions). The examination is deferred due to the virtual nature of the visit, but multiple problems are addressed with some risk (postoperative pain, anticoagulation with prior bleeding episode, opioid prescription management). The medical decision making is of low complexity: the problems are stable/improving, medication management is addressed, but the history and exam elements do not reach moderate or high complexity, and no additional workup or moderate risk prescription management (e.g., escalation) is present. Thus, 99213 (expanded problem focused, low MDM) is supported, but not 99214 or higher.",

This note exceeds these requirements.",

          "code_99214": "To justify 99214, the documentation would need a detailed history (including extended HPI, plus review of several systems and at least one element of PFSH) and a detailed examination, which is inherently limited in virtual encounters without a physical exam. More importantly, the MDM would need to be of moderate complexity: e.g., management of complications, significant change in medication regimen, or new/worsening problems discussed with risk factors such as continued significant bleeding risk, coordination with other specialists, or new diagnostic workup. None of these are fully documented here.",
          "code_99215": "To bill 99215, the documentation would need to support a comprehensive history (extended HPI, complete ROS, complete PFSH); a comprehensive examination (not feasible in this telehealth context); and medical decision making of high complexity: i.e., a serious acute or chronic condition at risk of morbidity/mortality without interventions, major changes in therapy, extensive evaluation or diagnostic testing, or high risk due to drug therapy management complications. The patient's situation is somewhat complex (postoperative analgesia, prior bleed while on anticoagulation), but not to the degree meriting 99215 without additional clinical instability, active interventions, or new serious complications."

MDM is present at a low level. Rationale for medical necessity is present, focused on postoperative pain management, anticoagulation risk, and prescription refill. Clarify clinical guidance regarding Norco weaning and bleeding risk surveillance—further documentation of counseling/risk benefit discussion is recommended for higher risk cases.

She is currently taking Eliquis for DVT prophylaxis. She reports a recent episode of postoperative bleeding over the weekend, which has now resolved. She continues taking Norco 5-325 mg every 4 hours as prescribed for pain, and Celebrex for inflammation. Patient requests a refill of Norco at this visit.\n\nReview of Systems: Unable to perform detailed ROS due to virtual nature of visit; patient denies new or worsening symptoms outside of those documented in HPI.\n\nPast Medical, Family, Social History: Reviewed and unchanged since most recent visit.\n\nPhysical Examination: Examination deferred—unable to perform due to telehealth modality.\n\nAssessment:\n1. Acute postoperative pain, right TKA\n2. Acute postoperative bleeding (on Eliquis), resolved\n3. Right total knee arthroplasty (6/16/2025)\n\nPlan:\n- Continue DVT prophylaxis with Eliquis as directed\n- Continue physical therapy\n- Refill Norco with recommendation to begin weaning as healing progresses; risks/benefits of opioid therapy discussed\n- Supplement with Tylenol and anti-inflammatories as indicated\n- Monitor for any recurrent bleeding or new symptoms; patient educated on signs/symptoms to report\n- Follow-up scheduled for next postoperative visit next week\n\nThis note prepared and electronically signed by Hayley Foster, PA-C on 06/24/2025 at 14:12.\n\n[END OF NOTE]",
