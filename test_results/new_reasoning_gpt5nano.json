Patient states that she has been dealing with this pain for the past several weeks to months.  She states that it was excruciating 10 out of 10 low back pain with radiation of bilateral buttocks however no numbness tingling weakness in the bilateral lower extremities.  She even had a seek some injections and medications which provided only minimal relief now it is a 4 or 5 out of 10.  Patient states that her pain occurs a lot while she is sitting or when she is rising from sitting to standing and moving.\n\n## PAST MEDICAL HISTORY\nHep B complicating pregnancy.\n\n## MEDICATIONS\nMotrin and vitamin D\n\n## ALLERGIES\nNo known drug allergies\n\n## PHYSICAL EXAMINATION\nGeneral: Awake alert oriented, no acute distress.\nHEENT: Normocephalic atraumatic extract muscles intact\nPulmonary: No EXTR\nAbdomen: Obese female with a BMI of 45.\nNeurological: 5-5 strength throughout, sensation intact light touch throughout, negative Hoffmann's bilaterally, reflexes 2 out of 4 throughout, negative straight leg raise bilaterally.  Normal gait.\nMSK: Nontender palpation of cervical thoracic or lumbar spine or bilateral PSIS.\n\n## IMAGING\nMRI of the lumbar spine shows disc herniations at L3-L4 L4-L5 and L5-S1.  X-rays of the lumbar spine show no evidence of scoliosis however there is disc collapse particularly at L3-L4 and L4-L5.  There is evidence of spondylolisthesis at L3-L4.\n\n## IMPRESSIONS\n53-year-old Caucasian female presents to the Warren clinic with chief complaint of low back pain.  I believe there is a component of discogenic and mechanical back pain involved with disc herniations at L3-L4 with spondylolisthesis at this level, L4-L5 and L5-S1.\n\n## PLAN\n1.  I discussed with this patient weight loss.\n2.  Physical therapy\n3.  Pain management referral\n4.  Pain medication with meloxicam she was explained it is a stronger version ibuprofen and is to be taken instead of her current ibuprofen.\n5.  Referral to Dr. Hares for abdominal access for anterior lumbar interbody fusion.\n6.  I discussed with the patient that if she feels conservative management she would be a candidate for anterior lumbar interbody fusion with posterior instrumentation and fusion from L3-S1.\n7.  Follow-up in 2 weeks, patient states that she will be in Romania for the next 3 or so weeks and will follow-up in approximately 3 to 4 weeks.\nThis dictation was prepared using Dragon Medical voice recognition software.

                "justification": "Established patient with chronic lumbar spine disease with radiographic evidence of degenerative disc disease and pathology (L3-L4 L4-L5 L5-S1 disc herniations; L3-L4 spondylolisthesis) contributing to mechanical back pain. The visit includes extensive discussion of nonoperative management (weight loss, physical therapy, pain management) and a plan for surgical consultation (anterior lumbar interbody fusion with posterior instrumentation from L3-S1) depending on conservative management outcomes. The imaging findings (MRI and X-ray) have been reviewed and incorporated into the treatment plan, and the patient has obesity (BMI 45) which adds complexity and risk to management. These elements meet Moderate Medical Decision Making (MDM) per AMA 2025 guidelines: Problems addressed include a chronic spine condition with progression; Data reviewed/analyzed includes MRI/X-ray results; Risk of complications/morbidity is Moderate given planned consideration of major spine surgery and medical complexity. Time documentation is not explicit in the note, so MDM governs code selection rather than time-based criteria. Therefore, 99214 is appropriate.\n\nThe following information would be needed to justify each level:\n\n- 99212 (Straightforward MDM or 10-19 minutes):\n  - Documentation of a single self-limited or minor problem with minimal data review and minimal risk, and explicit total time 10-19 minutes.\n\n- 99213 (Low MDM or 20-29 minutes):\n  - Documentation of two or more self-limited or minor problems or one stable chronic illness; limited data reviewed (e.g., external notes or test results) and low risk; explicit total time 20-29 minutes.\n\n- 99214 (Moderate MDM or 30-39 minutes):\n  - Documentation of one or more chronic illnesses with progression or two or more stable chronic illnesses; moderate data review (e.g., extensive review of external notes and imaging results, possible independent interpretation) and moderate risk; explicit total time 30-39 minutes.\n\n- 99215 (High MDM or 40-54 minutes):\n  - Documentation of one or more chronic illnesses with severe exacerbation or high-risk management decisions (e.g., major spine surgery planning with potential hospitalization); extensive data review/interpretation and discussion with external providers; explicit total time 40-54 minutes.\n",
