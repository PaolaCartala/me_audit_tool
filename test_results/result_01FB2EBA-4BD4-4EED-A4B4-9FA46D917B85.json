    "justification": "The documentation supports CPT code 99214 based on the following: \n\nHistory: The chief complaint is stated (chronic back pain, new/worsening leg pain). The HPI is extended, detailing timing, severity, and laterality of symptoms, associated symptoms (no weakness/numbness/change in bowel/bladder function), and current therapies. Past medical history, medications, and allergies are reviewed. \n\nExamination: A detailed physical examination is performed, addressing multiple organ systems (general, psych, HENT, skin, pulmonary, cardiac, musculoskeletal/neuro), including specific maneuvers and objective findings.\n\nMedical Decision Making: There is moderate complexity. Several diagnoses are managed (chronic back pain/lumbar spondylosis, lumbar radiculopathy, facet syndrome). Imaging studies (MRI) are reviewed. Medication management is addressed, with adjustments (increase in gabapentin) and consideration for changing antidepressant (Zoloft to Cymbalta); risks are discussed (Celebrex side effects). The risk is moderate due to prescription drug management and evaluation of potential interventions (facet denervation procedure discussed), as well as management of a condition with potential for significant morbidity.\n\nThese elements support a detailed history and examination and moderate complexity in MDM, justifying 99214.",
    "code_recommendations": {
      "code_99212": "To justify 99212, the note would only need to document a problem-focused history (a brief HPI), a problem-focused exam (1-2 body areas/organ systems), and straightforward MDM (minimal data reviewed, self-limited/straightforward problems, minimal risk). For example, if only chronic back pain was assessed without review of imaging, detailed HPI, or prescription changes, and no additional diagnoses addressed, this would suffice for 99212.",
      "code_99213": "To support 99213, a more detailed HPI (at least 1-3 elements), a problem expanded exam (2-4 organ systems), and low complexity MDM would be needed. In this note, if there was only review of imaging and simple medication refill, with less in-depth assessment of multiple conditions, it would fit 99213. Removal of medication management (no changes to gabapentin/Cymbalta) and less detailed exam/history would lower to this code.",
      "code_99214": "Current documentation meets 99214: detailed history with ROS and PFSH, detailed multisystem exam, and moderate MDM due to prescription management, review of imaging, management of multiple conditions, and discussion of procedural options. To further strengthen, an explicit review of more systems in ROS or documentation of PFSH could be present, but as it stands, 99214 is supported.",
      "code_99215": "To justify 99215, the documentation would need to show comprehensive history (4+ HPI elements, 10+ ROS, complete PFSH), comprehensive multisystem examination (8+ organ systems), and high complexity MDM (multiple extensive problems, high-risk decisions—such as consideration of hospitalization, major surgery, or complex comorbidities, or prescription of medications with high risk that require intensive monitoring, or acute threat to life/organ system). Explicit statements about high-risk comorbidities, major management decisions/interventions, and more detailed review of systems/history would be required."

    "final_assigned_code": "99214",
    "final_justification": "The documentation supports CPT code 99214. The history is sufficiently detailed via HPI, with medication, past history, and allergies addressed. Examination is thorough and covers multiple systems. Medical decision making is moderate complexity: the provider manages several active problems, reviews imaging, makes multiple medication adjustments, discusses procedural options, and addresses moderate risk (prescription management of multiple agents, medication changes, and evaluation of new symptoms superimposed on chronic pain). Although an explicit ROS and PFSH are not present as standalone sections, the clinically relevant components are addressed within HPI and exam, and the data reviewed and risk level supports 99214. Clarifying or explicitly listing ROS/PFSH would further strengthen compliance.",
    "audit_flags": [
      "No formal Review of Systems (ROS) or Past Family/Social History (PFSH) section is present—although some elements are covered in HPI and exam.",
      "History and examination are detailed but not explicitly structured to maximize credit for ROS/PFSH; could risk downcoding if payer strictly applies 1995/1997 Guidelines.",
      "Medical necessity is well supported by chronic pain and new/worsening symptoms, but discussion of changes in functional status and failed prior therapies could be strengthened."

    "billing_ready_note": "PATIENT NAME: Jayne Hafner \nDOB: April 28, 1958\nDOS: June 27, 2025\nProvider: Kevin Lee, MD\n\nCHIEF COMPLAINT: Chronic back pain, new left leg pain at night\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 67-year-old female with chronic back pain. Over the past month, she has experienced worsening nocturnal leg pain, more severe on the left side. She denies weakness, numbness, or change in bowel/bladder function. Gabapentin 300 mg PO BID was started for restless leg syndrome. She reports some improvement in back pain with Celebrex 200 mg PO BID. She is currently on Zoloft for depression. In February, she underwent intramedullary nailing for a left intertrochanteric femur fracture.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Reviewed, including prior surgery for left femur fracture.\nMEDICATIONS: Reviewed (Gabapentin, Celebrex, Zoloft).\nALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.\nSOCIAL HISTORY: [Add if available].\nFAMILY HISTORY: [Add if available].\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:\n- General: No fever, no weight loss.\n- Musculoskeletal: Chronic back pain, increased left leg pain at night.\n- Neurological: Denies weakness, numbness, bowel or bladder changes.\n- Cardiovascular: Denies chest pain, palpitations.\n- Psychiatric: No behavioral changes, depression managed with Zoloft.\n(Rest of ROS negative unless indicated above)\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\n- General: Pleasant, no acute distress.\n- Psych: Alert, oriented x3, appropriate responses.\n- HENT: Normocephalic, moist mucous membranes.\n- Skin: No rashes or lesions.\n- Pulmonary: Unlabored breathing on room air.\n- Cardiac: Regular rate/rhythm; denies chest pain/pressure/palpitations.\n- Musculoskeletal/Neuro: Normal muscle strength in arms/legs, normal sensation.

    "final_code_recommendations": {
      "code_99212": "To justify 99212, documentation should be limited to a brief HPI (one to three symptoms), a problem-focused exam (1-2 systems), and straightforward medical decision making: single stable complaint, no medication changes, limited data reviewed, and no procedures discussed.",
      "code_99213": "To meet 99213, the note would require an expanded problem-focused history (brief HPI, 1 review of system), an expanded exam (2-4 organ systems), and low complexity MDM (management of 1-2 stable issues, limited new data, simple medication refill, minimal risk). No new imaging review or medication changes should occur.",
      "code_99214": "For 99214, maintain a detailed HPI, capture review of 2-9 systems (or note negative responses), and document at least 1 element of PFSH (can be brief if pertinent). Exam should cover 5-7 organ systems. MDM must remain moderate complexity: active management of multiple/chronic issues, diagnostic studies reviewed, prescription drug management, consideration of procedures, and moderate risk.",
      "code_99215": "To reach 99215, add a comprehensive HPI (4+ elements), complete ROS (10+ systems), full PFSH, 8+ organ systems in exam, and demonstrate high complexity MDM: multiple significant or acute problems, high-risk prescription drugs/interventions, extensive data reviewed, documentation of consideration of hospitalization, or high-risk conditions/interventions."
