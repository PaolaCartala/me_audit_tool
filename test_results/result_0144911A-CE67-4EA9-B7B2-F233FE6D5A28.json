    "justification": "This encounter features a detailed history and examination, plus moderate complexity medical decision making. Patient presents with bilateral foot complaints: a recurrent ingrown toenail (acute issue requiring a procedure) and right ankle swelling (chronic, with discussion of venous insufficiency and imaging reviewed). Examination covers both feet and addresses biomechanics, swelling, and assessment for infection. Imaging (ankle radiographs) is reviewed, adding to complexity. Medical decision making includes managing multiple problems (one acute, one chronic), in-office partial nail avulsion procedure, and review/interpretation of imaging. Plan includes further referral, ongoing management, and surgical planning, consistent with moderate (not high) complexity. Two of three key components (history, exam, MDM) meet detailed/moderate level, supporting 99214.",
    "code_recommendations": {
      "code_99212": "To qualify for 99212, documentation could be reduced to a single, self-limited problem (e.g., mild ankle swelling), with a brief history, minimal ROS, limited exam (e.g., only ankle), and straightforward decision making (no procedure, no imaging, simple advice). The current note is more complex than 99212.",
      "code_99213": "To support 99213, documentation should demonstrate an expanded problem focused history and exam, and low complexity MDM. If only the chronic right ankle swelling was addressed (without acute ingrown toenail or procedure) or if the imaging was not interpreted, this might qualify as 99213. Current note exceeds low complexity, justifying a higher code.",
      "code_99214": "Current documentation already meets 99214: detailed history (multiple issues, review of systems), detailed exam (multiple body areas), moderate complexity MDM (multiple diagnoses, review of imaging, in-office procedure, new referral/plan). No additional information needed.",
      "code_99215": "To support 99215, documentation would need: a comprehensive history and exam (all 3 PFSH elements, at least 10 ROS, 8+ organ systems), and high complexity MDM (high risk e.g., drug therapy requiring intensive monitoring, abrupt deterioration, life-threatening diagnosis, or extensive data review/coordination). Documentation of additional comorbidities, high-risk treatment (e.g., immunosuppression, hospital admission), or a critically ill status would be needed."

    "final_assigned_code": "99214",
    "final_justification": "The documentation supports code 99214: history and exam address multiple problem areas (bilateral foot/ankle complaints), a minor surgical procedure (nail avulsion) is performed, imaging is reviewed, and the management includes multi-step care plans and coordination (referral, home care, future consideration of surgery). Although an explicit review of systems and family/social history are not separately itemized, the overall complexity and moderate MDM support 99214. There is minor risk regarding missing ROS and PFSH details, but not enough to downcode since the HPI, exam, and MDM are robust.",
    "audit_flags": [
      "Family/social history is missing; only history of present illness is documented, which may limit completeness of history element for code 99214 under 1995/1997 guidelines.",
      "A review of systems is not explicitly documented, although a brief negative finding is implied by absence of trauma/infection.",
      "Procedure note for nail avulsion is present and supports MDM, but a formal consent, laterality, and procedure-specific risk discussion are not detailed (though not always required for E/M, but best practice for compliance).",
      "Time is not documented; if coding by time was considered, this is a gap.",
      "The plan for future partial permanent nail removal is included but lacks specifics about patient understanding or risk/benefit discussion."

She reports recurrent ingrown toenail of the left hallux (medial border), with discomfort upon shoe pressure and ambulation, and right ankle swelling with mild discomfort. Swelling is chronic and worsens in the evening. She denies recent trauma. [No new review of systems or family/social history was provided.]\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\n- Right ankle: Mild local swelling noted, minimal tenderness to palpation. Flatfoot biomechanics observed.\n- Left hallux: Acute nail border ingrowth and irritation, no evidence of infection.\n\nSTUDIES/IMAGING:\n- Right ankle radiographs (3 views): No trauma, uniform ankle joint.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Right ankle impingement secondary to flatfoot biomechanics.\n2. Venous insufficiency with tidal swelling, right > left.\n3. Acute medial ingrown toenail, left hallux.\n\nPLAN:\n- Consultation regarding venous insufficiency; compression and elevation recommended for right ankle.\n- Continue supportive shoes and orthotics for biomechanical foot management.\n- Partial nail avulsion performed today for the left medial hallux under local anesthesia (1-3cc 1% lidocaine plain). Alcohol prep and removal of offending nail border to the eponychium. Ointment applied, dry dressing placed. Home wound care instructions given. Patient consented to the procedure.\n- Future partial permanent nail removal discussed; patient to return as needed.\n\nProvider: Randy Leff, DPM (Electronically signed 06/30/2025, 06:21)\n\n[Preparation note: Errors in voice recognition dictation have been corrected when identified.
