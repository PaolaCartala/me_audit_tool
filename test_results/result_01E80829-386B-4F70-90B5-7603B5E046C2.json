    "justification": "The visit documents a follow-up for low back pain with radiculopathy in the setting of lumbar spondylosis, spondylolisthesis, and stenosis. The history is expanded problem focused: brief HPI, no ROS, no PFSH. The exam is expanded problem focused: assessment of lumbosacral spine, neuro exam, vital signs. Medical decision making is of low complexity, as the problem is established and improving, with continued conservative therapy and consideration of escalation only if symptoms worsen; moderate diagnoses (multiple chronic stable problems), limited data (none reviewed in visit), low risk (conservative management, meds continued, procedural options deferred). Documentation meets 2 of 3 key components for 99213 but does not reach the moderate complexity or thoroughness required for 99214.",
    "code_recommendations": {
      "code_99212": "To support 99212, documentation could be even briefer: only a problem focused HPI, limited examination (focused on area of complaint), and straightforward medical decision making (self-limited/minor problems, minimal medication management). This note already exceeds this with expanded history, a broader exam, and low MDM.",
      "code_99213": "This level is supported by the current documentation: expanded problem focused history/exam, low complexity MDM (chronic musculoskeletal problem, conservative management, limited risk, minimal data reviewed).",
      "code_99214": "For 99214, need at least a detailed history (including extended HPI, 2-9 ROS, and 1 PFSH), detailed exam (2+ organ systems/6+ bullets), and moderate complexity MDM (more data reviewed/ordered, more active management changes, or increased risk—e.g., prescription of new medication, imaging reviewed, new consultant, or discussing/finalizing invasive procedure).",
      "code_99215": "To support 99215, require a comprehensive history (4+ HPI elements, 10+ ROS, all PFSH), comprehensive exam (8+ organ systems), and high complexity MDM (multiple new/unstable problems, extensive data review, high risk interventions, or immediate high-risk management decisions). Current documentation does not approach this level."

Documentation does not support 99214 as history and exam are not sufficiently detailed and MDM is not moderate complexity.",

      "History and exam are expanded problem focused, not detailed—limits code assignment to 99213 or below.",

Overall, improvement is noted after completing physical therapy. Current pain is 1/10. Reports occasional shock-like radiating sensation down right lower extremity. Able to ambulate and perform most activities of daily living. Using meloxicam as needed. Anxious to resume full exercise regimen.\n\nPhysical Exam:\nHeight: 5'0\" Weight: 150 lbs\nRespirations: Regular, unlabored\nAmbulates independently in clinic\nLumbosacral spine: No significant midline or paraspinal tenderness. Full strength in lower extremities; no focal weakness. No gross neuro deficits; patient neurovascularly stable.\n\nAssessment:\n1. Acute on chronic low back pain with radiculopathy, lumbar spondylosis, L4-L5 spondylolisthesis, L3-L4 stenosis\n\nPlan:\n- Continue meloxicam as needed\n- Continue with current conservative management\n- Discussed options of lumbar epidural injection or laminectomy at L3-L4 if symptoms worsen; patient declines at this time\n- Return follow-up in 4 months for reassessment and to monitor pain control\n\nProvider: Hayley Foster, PA-C (with Dr. Joseph Maslak present)\nSigned electronically on 06/25/2025",

      "code_99212": "For 99212, documentation could be briefer—limited HPI (1-3 elements), single system/focused exam, and straightforward MDM (self-limited or minor problems with minimal treatment, minimal to no medication management). Current documentation exceeds this level.",
      "code_99213": "Current note fully supports 99213: expanded problem focused history (brief HPI, no ROS/PFSH), expanded problem focused exam (spinal and neuro assessment), low complexity MDM (status of known problems improving, conservative therapy continued, low risk).",
      "code_99214": "To support 99214: Add extended HPI (4+ elements), at least 2-9 ROS, and at least 1 PFSH; exam should include at least 2 systems/6+ bullets; MDM should reflect moderate complexity (increased risk, new therapies, additional data reviewed or managed, or active management changes). None of these requirements are met in current documentation.",
      "code_99215": "For 99215, require comprehensive history (4+ HPI, 10+ ROS, all PFSH), comprehensive exam (8+ systems/organ bullets), and high complexity MDM (high risk problem/situation, significant intervention or imminent threat, extensive data review/action). The current encounter does not meet any of these components."
