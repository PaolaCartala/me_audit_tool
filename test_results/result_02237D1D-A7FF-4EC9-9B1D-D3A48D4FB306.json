    "justification": "The note documents a follow-up visit for a patient with chronic back issues (low back pain, spinal stenosis, degenerative scoliosis). The history is expanded problem focused: there is a chief complaint, a brief history of present illness (medication use, therapy response), but review of systems (ROS) and past/family/social history (PFSH) are minimal or absent. The examination covers general and musculoskeletal system, not detailed but expanded. The medical decision making is of low complexity: multiple stable chronic conditions are addressed, no new data reviewed or ordered, and minimal therapy adjustments (continuing current plan, no active management changes). Risk is low as the patient is stable, and no new prescription management or diagnostic procedures are initiated. Thus, code 99213 is most appropriate for this follow-up with low complexity medical decision making and moderate documentation elements.",
    "code_recommendations": {
      "code_99212": "To bill 99212, documentation could be briefer: a chief complaint and a very focused history (one to three HPI elements), problem-focused exam limited to one area/system, and straightforward medical decision making with minimal problems (e.g., one self-limited problem or minor chronic issue). Less detail on history/exam and single minor stable problem would support 99212.",
      "code_99213": "Current documentation meets 99213 criteria: expanded problem focused history and exam (covers main musculoskeletal problem, brief medication/use information), and low complexity MDM (multiple chronic stable conditions, no new management). To bill consistently at this level, maintain or enhance brief HPI and multi-system exam.",
      "code_99214": "To support 99214, add details: a detailed HPI (four+ elements), complete ROS (at least two systems), at least one element from PFSH. Expand the exam to cover more systems (detailed musculoskeletal, neurological). For MDM, show moderate complexity: consider current management change, review/order new studies, or document prescription drug management or new problems needing evaluation. Document additional risk factors or moderate risk interventions.",
      "code_99215": "To bill 99215, a comprehensive history (chief complaint, 4+ HPI, complete ROS, and complete PFSH), a comprehensive exam (multi-system detailed), and high complexity MDM are required. Document severe exacerbation, significant new complaints, prescription management with increased risk (e.g., opioids), review of multiple new diagnostic studies, or consideration of surgery/interventions. High risk management or extensive comorbidities should be present and addressed clearly in the note."

    "final_justification": "The documentation supports CPT 99213: an expanded problem focused history (chief complaint with brief HPI, but lacking ROS and PFSH), an expanded problem focused examination (general plus musculoskeletal), and medical decision making of low complexity (multiple chronic stable problems, no new data/review, and minimal medication management). There is clear medical necessity for the visit (chronic back pain and follow-up), but to bill higher-level codes, more detail would be needed in HPI, complete ROS/PFSH, a broader examination, and higher complexity MDM. Below this level, the detail and complexity would be insufficient for 99214 or 99215 and exceed minimal documentation for 99212.",

      "Physical exam is relatively focused (general and musculoskeletal), not multi-system or detailed.",

He reports he is doing quite well overall. He has been using Tylenol occasionally and takes tramadol infrequently. He notes that physical therapy has not provided significant benefit, but his current symptoms are stable.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\nGeneral: Height 5'10\", Weight 165 lbs, using a cane for ambulation.\nSpine: No bony or paraspinal tenderness. Gait with forward flexed posture noted.\nLower extremity strength: 5/5 in hip flexors, quadriceps, hamstrings, anterior tibialis bilaterally. No new focal deficits.\n\nREVIEW OF STUDIES:\nNo new imaging or other diagnostic studies since prior visit.\n\nASSESSMENT:\n1. Chronic low back pain\n2. Spinal stenosis with neurogenic claudication\n3. Degenerative scoliosis\n\nPLAN:\n- Continue current medication regimen. No refill needed at this time.\n- Continue and complete current course of physical therapy.\n- Call if medication refill is needed before next appointment.\n- Return for follow-up in 3 months, or sooner if symptoms worsen or concerns arise.\n\nThis note was prepared using Dragon Medical voice recognition software. While efforts have been made to correct any errors, if any remain, they are unintentional.\n\nElectronically signed by Kelley Gray-Allen, PA-C on 06/26/2025 at 15:30",
    "final_code_recommendations": {
      "code_99212": "This level would be justified with a single stable chronic problem, limited/brief HPI, and very focused exam. The current note exceeds this by addressing multiple chronic problems and a more detailed assessment. To support 99212, further reduce the history and exam sections.",
      "code_99213": "Documentation as written supports 99213: expanded problem-focused history and examination, low complexity MDM with multiple stable chronic issues, minimal or no active management changes. Maintain or add brief elements from ROS and PFSH for even stronger support at this level.",
      "code_99214": "To elevate to 99214, add more detailed HPI (at least 4 elements), two or more items in ROS, at least one PFSH, and a detailed (multi-system) examination. Show moderate complexity medical decision making: consider adding prescribed medication with monitoring, review/order of new studies, or new management interventions.",
      "code_99215": "Requires documentation of comprehensive history (chief complaint, extended HPI, complete ROS and PFSH), comprehensive (multi-system) exam, and high complexity decision making (multiple new complaints, advanced diagnostic studies, prescription management with risks, or consideration of high-risk interventions). None of these are present in the current note."
