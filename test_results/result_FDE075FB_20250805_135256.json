    "justification": "Based on the AMA 2025 E/M guidelines, this encounter supports CPT code 99214, which requires moderate medical decision making (MDM) or 30-39 minutes of total time on the day of the encounter for an established patient. \n\nMDM Complexity:\n- Problems Addressed: The patient presents with multiple chronic illnesses—hypertension (now uncontrolled), type 2 diabetes mellitus (poorly controlled), and hyperlipidemia (under active treatment). Additionally, the patient reports new, concerning symptoms (chest discomfort) which necessitate further evaluation for possible cardiac etiology. Per the guidelines, this complexity (one or more chronic illnesses with exacerbation/progression, or one undiagnosed new problem with uncertain prognosis) places the problem complexity at moderate.\n- Data Reviewed/Analyzed: The provider orders a stress test and EKG, reviews home BP and glucose logs, and plans for lab follow-up (A1c and lipid panel). There is also referral planned for nutrition and possible future cardiology consult. This supports moderate data review/analysis complexity (ordering/reviewing multiple diagnostic tests, addressing diagnostic uncertainty with new symptoms).\n- Risk of Complications/Morbidity/Mortality: The patient is being managed with changes to antihypertensive and diabetic medication regimens, which is considered prescription drug management (moderate risk). Evaluation for possible cardiac etiology (workup for possible angina) also supports moderate risk.\n- Time: The documented total time spent on the date of the encounter is 35 minutes, falling squarely within the 30-39 minute range required for 99214.\n\nTherefore, BOTH MDM and time criteria are satisfied for CPT code 99214. ",
    "code_recommendations": {
      "code_99212": "- Limit the problems addressed to no more than one self-limited/minor issue (e.g., only a stable chronic condition without exacerbation or new symptoms).\n- Document that no new diagnostic workup or medication changes were needed.\n- Reflect only minimal data reviewed or ordered.\n- Indicate total time spent was strictly between 10-19 minutes and was for a brief follow-up without any counseling beyond routine education.",
      "code_99213": "- Limit the problems to one stable chronic illness or one acute uncomplicated illness/injury.\n- Document less complexity (e.g., no uncontrolled or new concerning symptoms, routine follow-up with no medication adjustments or diagnostic test orders).\n- Show limited data reviewed/ordered (e.g., only one or two routine lab orders; no involvement of other healthcare professionals).\n- Indicate total time was 20-29 minutes and most of the management was straightforward.",
      "code_99214": "- Ensure moderate MDM by addressing either chronic illnesses with exacerbation/progression, or a new problem with uncertain prognosis.\n- Document moderate complexity in data reviewed (multiple test orders; possible external notes review; coordination with other providers, such as nutritionist or pending referral).\n- Reflect moderate risk due to prescription drug management or evaluation of new symptoms with potential systemic impact.\n- Ensure total time was between 30-39 minutes, as documented.",
      "code_99215": "- Indicate one or more chronic illnesses with severe exacerbation, progression, or life-threatening complications.\n- Document an acute or chronic illness/injury that poses a threat to life or bodily function (e.g., unstable angina, new heart failure, or signs of acute coronary syndrome).\n- Show extensive data review: independent interpretation of complex tests, multiple external record reviews, active discussion with multiple other healthcare professionals (e.g., calling a cardiologist during this visit).\n- Time spent is 40-54 minutes on the encounter date; document in detail all major counseling, coordination, and data review undertaken that day."

    "final_assigned_code": "99214",
    "final_justification": "The encounter meets the AMA 2025 criteria for 99214 by both MDM and time. MDM is moderate: the provider managed multiple chronic conditions (hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia) with documented exacerbation in hypertension and diabetes, as well as new chest discomfort requiring workup—classifying the problems addressed as either exacerbations/progression of chronic illnesses or a new undiagnosed issue with possible cardiac etiology. Multiple diagnostic tests were ordered (stress test, EKG, ongoing labs), including coordination with nutrition and potential cardiology referral, satisfying moderate data complexity. The risk is moderate given prescription drug management (increase in antihypertensive and diabetes medications) and evaluation for cardiac symptoms. Total time documented is 35 minutes, within the 30-39 minute range for 99214. Medical necessity and established patient criteria are met. Documentation is thorough, with no compliance risks.",

      "score_deductions": [
        "- Score reduced by 1 point: Not all data elements (e.g., external note review or independent test interpretation) are explicitly detailed, though appropriate orders and complexity are present.",

    "code_evaluations": {
      "code_99212_evaluation": "The agent's recommendation for 99212 is appropriate. This code level would only be justified if the visit addressed a self-limited or minor problem without medication adjustments, no new symptoms requiring extensive workup, minimal data reviewed/ordered, and a brief time of 10-19 minutes. The current visit addresses multiple chronic illnesses with exacerbation/progression and involves medication changes and multiple orders, making 99212 incorrect for this scenario.",
      "code_99213_evaluation": "The recommendation for 99213 correctly describes the requirements: one stable chronic illness, or one acute uncomplicated illness, with limited data and low risk, and 20-29 minutes of time. The current encounter exceeds these parameters—the visit involves poorly controlled hypertension and diabetes, a new concerning symptom (chest discomfort), and requires new diagnostic testing and medication adjustment. 99213 understates the complexity, so it is not appropriate here.",
      "code_99214_evaluation": "The requirements and justification for 99214 are accurately stated by the agent and reflect AMA 2025 guidelines. Moderate MDM is supported by management of multiple chronic illnesses with exacerbation, ordering of multiple diagnostic tests, medication changes, and moderate risk. The time criterion (35 minutes) is properly met. The agent's description is complete and correct for this service.",
      "code_99215_evaluation": "The distinction for 99215 is appropriately defined: severe, life-threatening or highly complex problems, with extensive data review or interpretation and a time threshold of 40+ minutes. The current visit does not document severe or life-threatening exacerbations or major coordination with other providers (e.g., real-time cardiology consultation or complex test interpretation). As such, 99215 would constitute upcoding in this case."
