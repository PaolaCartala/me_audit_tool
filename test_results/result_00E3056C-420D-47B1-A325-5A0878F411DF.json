    "assigned_code": "99213",
    "justification": "The documentation supports assigning 99213 (Expanded Problem Focused, Low Complexity) for the following reasons: History includes a chief complaint with some HPI elements (painful fungal nails, risk factors, ingrown nails), but the ROS and PFSH are not detailed. The examination covers multiple body systems (Integument, Vascular, Nails, Neurological, MSK) in moderate detail. The medical decision making is low complexity: there are two stable problems (fungal nails and ingrown nail), two procedures performed (nail debridement, partial nail avulsion), but there is no indication of moderate or high risk, nor extensive data review.",
    "code_recommendations": {
      "code_99212": "To meet 99212, documentation would need only a brief HPI, a very limited exam focused on the problem (description of the affected nail only), and straightforward decision making (one minor problem, minimal risk, or no procedures performed).",
      "code_99213": "Documentation minimally meets 99213. To more clearly support this code, an expanded HPI and more defined exam elements should be present, with low-complexity medical decision making (as seen with two minor problems and performing in-office minor procedures).",
      "code_99214": "To justify 99214, the following would be needed: detailed HPI (4+ elements), ROS (2-9 systems), PFSH (1 area), a detailed exam (4+ organ systems or body areas), and moderate complexity medical decision making (either a new problem with additional workup planned, prescription drug management, or higher risk, such as systemic infection suspicion, or detailed management discussion).",
      "code_99215": "To justify 99215, documentation would need a comprehensive HPI (4+ elements), full ROS (10+ systems), complete PFSH (all 3 areas), comprehensive exam (8+ organ systems), and high complexity MDM (serious problems, possible complications, need for intensive therapy, or high-risk procedures/interventions)."

  "auditor_agent": {
    "final_assigned_code": "99213",
    "final_justification": "The documentation supports 99213: the history meets problem-focused (chief complaint with several HPI elements), the exam is expanded problem-focused, and the medical decision making is of low complexity due to multiple minor problems and performance of low-risk procedures without complications. However, to support higher office visit codes, expanded HPI, ROS, and PFSH would be needed, along with more explicit structural detail in exam and risk stratification in MDM.",
    "audit_flags": [
      "ROS (Review of Systems) is absent or not documented; inclusion would improve higher code support.",
      "PFSH (Past, Family, Social History) is missing; necessary for codes 99214+ under 1997/1995 guidelines.",
      "HPI is limited (lacks duration, modifying factors, associated symptoms, context, severity, etc.), which restricts clear code justification.",
      "No explicit documentation of medical necessity for office visit, though implied by risk factors and procedures performed.",
      "Moderate detail in physical exam, but lacks clear quantification of body areas/systems examined."

He has a history of risk factors requiring medical care for his skin and nails. Additionally, the patient reports increasing discomfort from an ingrown nail at the right hallux medial border, interfering with ambulation. No fever, systemic symptoms, or ascending infection.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:\nConstitutional: Denies fever or chills.\nIntegumentary: As above (painful, thickened nail changes).\n\nPAST MEDICAL, FAMILY, SOCIAL HISTORY:\n(Not specifically documented in today's note.)\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\nIntegument: Nails thick, dark, with debris. Nail plates >2 mm thickness, irregular growth. Local pain, swelling, and redness at right hallux medial border. No ascending infection.\nVascular: Pulses present; CFT normal; hair distribution, temperature, and absence of varicosities noted.\nNeurological: Reflexes normal, sensation intact by SWMF wire.\nMusculoskeletal: Pes planus noted.\n\nASSESSMENT:\n1. Painful onychomycosis (fungal nails)\n2. Ingrown toenail(s) - right hallux\n\nPLAN:\n1. 11721 - Extensive debridement of 6-10 toenails, removing fungal material and necrotic debris to healthy tissue using nippers and debridement tools.\n2. 11730 - Partial nail avulsion on affected right hallux after local anesthetic block, removal of offending nail segment, application of dry dressing, home wound care instructions provided.\n\nElectronically signed by: Leff, Fred B DPM\nDate: 06/25/2025, 8:36 PM",
    "final_code_recommendations": {
      "code_99212": "Would require a more limited history (single symptom focus, minimal HPI), examination (limited to single system or just nails), and medical decision making (single minor problem, no procedures or just routine care). Current documentation exceeds this minimal threshold.",
      "code_99213": "Current note meets necessary criteria. To strengthen, document 1-2 more HPI elements (duration, severity, modifying factors), provide a brief ROS, and clarify link between problems and procedures.",
      "code_99214": "Would require detailed HPI (4+ elements), relevant ROS, one area of PFSH, a detailed exam (4+ organ systems/areas), and explicit moderate-complexity MDM (e.g., systemic infection suspected, prescription medication managed, or complications considered). Enhancement of medical decision-making and more comprehensive documentation would be necessary.",
      "code_99215": "Would require a comprehensive HPI, full ROS and PFSH, a comprehensive 8+ system exam, and high-complexity MDM—such as unstable patient, serious complications, hospital-level care, or new/serious diagnoses. Not supported by current documentation."
