    "justification": "The documentation reflects an established patient office visit for follow-up of chronic low back pain and sacroiliitis, post L5-S1 fusion. The history documents the chief complaint, relevant HPI, and a pertinent negative (no radiating symptoms). There is no detailed ROS or PFSH. The exam covers the constitutional system and focused lumbosacral/lower extremity musculoskeletal and neurological findings. Medical decision-making is low complexity: ongoing pain management for stable symptoms, no new workup or high-risk interventions planned, and routine follow-up. No acute issues or significant changes in management were addressed, nor was extensive data reviewed. The note supports an expanded problem-focused history and exam, with low complexity MDM, which justifies 99213. Documentation does not meet moderate complexity (data review, new treatment, or acute changes) required for 99214, nor the problem-focused brevity and straightforward MDM of 99212.",
    "code_recommendations": {
      "code_99212": "To support 99212, documentation should be briefer: limited to a chief complaint and short HPI. Examination would be minimal (focused on 1-2 elements), and MDM must be straightforward (very stable chronic problem, no new data reviewed, no discussion of further procedures or Rx management, only continued current plan).",
      "code_99213": "Current note supports 99213 based on expanded problem-focused history and exam with low complexity MDM regarding a stable chronic problem with routine follow-up.",
      "code_99214": "For 99214, more detail is neededâ€”a detailed HPI, more comprehensive ROS, and PFSH. Exam should be more extensive, covering additional organ systems. Moderate complexity MDM would require discussion of treatment changes (such as new medication or procedures), interpretation of tests, or addressing complications. Higher risk planning, new referrals, or acute exacerbations could further support this level.",
      "code_99215": "To support 99215, documentation should show a comprehensive history (including detailed HPI, full ROS, and complete PFSH), a comprehensive multi-system exam, and high complexity decision-making (e.g., multiple or significant new problems, extensive data review, high-risk medication management or the consideration of urgent surgical intervention, or acute threats to health status)."

    "final_justification": "The provider note supports a 99213 for an established patient with a stable chronic condition. The history includes an adequate chief complaint and HPI. Physical examination covers the constitutional and pertinent musculoskeletal/neurologic findings as appropriate for the encounter. Medical decision-making reflects low complexity (stable chronic problem, no new issues, ongoing management, and low risk). There is no documentation of extensive ROS, PFSH, comprehensive exam, major data review, or new advanced management/risk that would warrant higher codes. 99212 would require further reduction in documentation and demonstration of even lower complexity, while 99214+ require broader data, exam, or escalation in management/risk.",
    "audit_flags": [
      "The documentation lacks a review of systems (ROS) and past, family, social history (PFSH), limiting it to expanded problem focused history. This could be an issue if payers expect explicit notation even for low MDM; most would accept as written unless carrier-specific scrutiny exists.",
      "Medical necessity is reasonably clear but not expressly reiterated beyond stating stability and planned ongoing follow-up.",
      "The physical exam is focused and appropriately limited, but additional elements may be needed for higher codes."

She reports doing well overall, with good symptom control since last visit, managed with periodic injections. No new symptoms, no radiating pain or neurological complaints.\n\nPhysical Exam:\n- Vital signs: Height 5'5\", Weight 145 lbs, respirations regular and unlabored.\n- General: Ambulates without assistance.\n- Spine: No significant midline or paraspinal tenderness, SI joints nontender.\n- Neurologic: Negative straight leg raise, 5/5 lower extremity strength, no focal deficits.\n\nImpression:\n1. History of L5-S1 circumferential fusion (2023, Dr. Abiola)\n2. Sacroiliitis, stable and responding to injections\n\nPlan:\n- Continue pain management with periodic injections under Dr. Oddo.\n- Discussed that if symptoms recur or worsen, SI fusion could be considered.\n- Routine follow-up in several months or sooner if needed.\n\nDictation prepared via Dragon Medical; efforts made to correct errors. \n\nElectronically signed by: Hayley Foster, PA-C and Joseph Maslak, MD\nDate/Time: 06/25/2025, 16:29",
    "final_code_recommendations": {
      "code_99212": "Would require further brevity in the note (limited HPI, minimal exam, only continuation of current management, with no discussion of procedures or referrals). Examples: only stating patient is stable, no complaints, and will continue follow-up.",
      "code_99213": "Current documentation supports this code for a stable chronic problem/follow-up with expanded problem-focused history and exam, low complexity MDM. No additional elements required for this level.",
      "code_99214": "To reach 99214, include a detailed HPI, at least 2-9 systems in ROS, and 1 element each from PFSH. The exam should extend to additional organ systems. MDM should show moderate complexity (e.g., new test orders, medication changes, new procedures, consideration of SI fusion as more than a distant possibility, or addressing complications). If more data is reviewed/interpreted, or risk increases (e.g., discussing imminent SI fusion), could justify 99214.",
      "code_99215": "Would require comprehensive documentation: extended HPI, full ROS, complete PFSH, comprehensive multi-system exam, and high complexity MDM (new significant or acute issues, major medication/procedure changes, extensive data/interventions, or urgent risks addressed). Not supported by current documentation."
