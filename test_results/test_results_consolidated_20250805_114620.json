There is also a new symptom (atypical chest pain) being actively worked up, with potential cardiac implications, making this an undiagnosed new problem with uncertain prognosis or acute illness with systemic symptoms.\n- Data Reviewed/Analyzed: Stress test and EKG are ordered; assessment of home readings; external data review is implied but not specifically documented, so counted as moderate.\n- Risk: Prescription drug management is performed (medication adjustments for hypertension and diabetes). Further, ordering stress test and consideration of cardiology referral indicate moderate risk due to potential cardiac involvement.\n\nTime: The provider documents 35 minutes of total time, which falls within the 30-39 minute window for 99214 per AMA guidelines.\n\nGiven that both the moderate MDM and total time criteria are met and clearly documented, 99214 is correct. 99215 would require high complexity and/or 40+ minutes (not met). 99212 or 99213 would fail to capture the complexity/amount of work involved in this encounter.",

        "final_justification": "This encounter fully supports CPT 99214 under AMA 2025 guidelines: (1) Medical Decision Making (MDM): Moderate complexity is evidenced by multiple poorly controlled chronic conditions (hypertension, diabetes), medication up-titration for both, and a new, potentially cardiac symptom (atypical chest pain) receiving diagnostic workup (stress test, EKG) and possible specialty referral. The data reviewed—ordering of moderate-risk tests—along with active medication management and concern for cardiac etiology support moderate risk. (2) Time: 35 minutes of total encounter time, with more than half for counseling and care coordination, fits squarely in the 30-39 minute window for 99214. Lower (99212/99213) codes would miss the complexity and work documented, and 99215 requires higher complexity or more than 40 minutes, neither of which is present. Documentation is complete for all required elements for compliance.",

Reports increased fatigue and chest discomfort.\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 59-year-old male with poorly controlled hypertension and diabetes. For the past 2 weeks, he reports worsening fatigue, elevated home BP (150-160/90-95), fasting sugars 180-220, and dietary indiscretions. Intermittent chest tightness with exertion, 2-3 min, relieved with rest. No SOB, palpitations, or diaphoresis. Medications: metformin 1000mg BID, lisinopril 10mg daily, atorvastatin 40mg daily.

Hyperlipidemia—continue atorvastatin, recheck lipids in 3 months.\nEducation: Reinforced medication, diet, exercise. Close follow-up needed for uncontrolled BP, diabetes, chest symptoms.\nTime: 35 minutes total on the date of the encounter (majority spent on counseling/coordination).\nAll elements substantiate CPT 99214 per AMA 2025 guidelines.",
        "confidence_score": 98,
        "confidence_reasoning": "The confidence score is 98 due to very robust, unambiguous documentation supporting both moderate MDM and explicit encounter time. All chronic disease management, medication changes, and new symptom workup is outlined with sufficient detail for 99214 per AMA 2025. All regulatory compliance and billing-readiness checks are fulfilled. Only a minor decrease in confidence arises from the lack of explicit documentation of external data review or provider communication (e.g., obtaining results from a prior care team or consult); however, this is not required to justify 99214 in this case. Further clarification could be added by noting whether prior outside reports were reviewed, but the elements documented are clearly sufficient for the final code.",

          "code_99212_evaluation": "The provided recommendations correctly identify 99212 as limited to a single stable minor problem (no medication change, no new concerning symptoms, no significant counseling, no advanced workup), which does not fit this documented case. The agent's guideline is accurate; 99212 would under-code this visit.",
          "code_99213_evaluation": "The 99213 recommendations are correct—one stable chronic illness or uncomplicated acute problem with low complexity, no medication change, and basic/opportunistic history or labs. This case requires substantially more work (medication changes, workup of new chest symptoms, inadequate control of chronic diseases), so 99213 would also under-code. The enhancement agent's outline is accurate.",
          "code_99214_evaluation": "Recommendations for 99214 are spot on: multiple chronic illnesses with poor control, medication titration, new symptom workup with moderate-risk diagnostics, and required education/counseling, all with moderate-level MDM and within the correct time window. This documentation matches 99214 by both MDM and time. The code is fully justified by the encounter note.",
          "code_99215_evaluation": "Recommendations appropriately set 99215 at a much higher bar—severe exacerbation, high likelihood of organ/life risk, major data review/discussion, hospital-level decisions, or prolonged time (>40 min). None of these are documented, and 99215 would constitute upcoding. The agent's criteria and rationale are entirely appropriate."
