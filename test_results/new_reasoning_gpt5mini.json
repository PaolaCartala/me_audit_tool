Patient states that she has been dealing with this pain for the past several weeks to months.  She states that it was excruciating 10 out of 10 low back pain with radiation of bilateral buttocks however no numbness tingling weakness in the bilateral lower extremities.  She even had a seek some injections and medications which provided only minimal relief now it is a 4 or 5 out of 10.  Patient states that her pain occurs a lot while she is sitting or when she is rising from sitting to standing and moving.\n\n## PAST MEDICAL HISTORY\nHep B complicating pregnancy.\n\n## MEDICATIONS\nMotrin and vitamin D\n\n## ALLERGIES\nNo known drug allergies\n\n## PHYSICAL EXAMINATION\nGeneral: Awake alert oriented, no acute distress.\nHEENT: Normocephalic atraumatic extract muscles intact\nPulmonary: No EXTR\nAbdomen: Obese female with a BMI of 45.\nNeurological: 5-5 strength throughout, sensation intact light touch throughout, negative Hoffmann's bilaterally, reflexes 2 out of 4 throughout, negative straight leg raise bilaterally.  Normal gait.\nMSK: Nontender palpation of cervical thoracic or lumbar spine or bilateral PSIS.\n\n## IMAGING\nMRI of the lumbar spine shows disc herniations at L3-L4 L4-L5 and L5-S1.  X-rays of the lumbar spine show no evidence of scoliosis however there is disc collapse particularly at L3-L4 and L4-L5.  There is evidence of spondylolisthesis at L3-L4.\n\n## IMPRESSIONS\n53-year-old Caucasian female presents to the Warren clinic with chief complaint of low back pain.  I believe there is a component of discogenic and mechanical back pain involved with disc herniations at L3-L4 with spondylolisthesis at this level, L4-L5 and L5-S1.\n\n## PLAN\n1.  I discussed with this patient weight loss.\n2.  Physical therapy\n3.  Pain management referral\n4.  Pain medication with meloxicam she was explained it is a stronger version ibuprofen and is to be taken instead of her current ibuprofen.\n5.  Referral to Dr. Hares for abdominal access for anterior lumbar interbody fusion.\n6.  I discussed with the patient that if she feels conservative management she would be a candidate for anterior lumbar interbody fusion with posterior instrumentation and fusion from L3-S1.\n7.  Follow-up in 2 weeks, patient states that she will be in Romania for the next 3 or so weeks and will follow-up in approximately 3 to 4 weeks.\nThis dictation was prepared using Dragon Medical voice recognition software.  As a result, errors may occur.  When identified, these errors have been corrected.  While every attempt is made to correct errors during dictation, errors may still exist.",

The encounter supports a Moderate Medical Decision Making (MDM) level (99214) based on AMA 2025 guidelines due to:\n- Problems addressed: The patient has more than one musculoskeletal problem with progression/impact (disc disease with degenerative changes and spondylolisthesis) plus obesity; this aligns with the category for a Moderate MDM where one or more chronic illnesses with exacerbation, progression, or side effects of treatment or two or more stable chronic illnesses are considered (MDM guide indicates moderate level when problems addressed include one or more chronic illnesses with exacerbation or two or more stable chronic illnesses).\n- Data Reviewed/Analyzed: External imaging studies (MRI and X-ray) were reviewed and used to support the diagnosis and treatment planning; this meets the Data component of Category 1/2 for MDM (review of prior external notes and/or tests and their results, with potential independent interpretation of tests and/or discussion of management with external physician as applicable). The note explicitly references MRI findings and disc collapse with spondylolisthesis which informs management decisions.\n- Risk: Moderate risk of morbidity from additional diagnostic testing or treatment is present, as evidenced by the discussion of potential surgical intervention (anterior lumbar interbody fusion with posterior instrumentation if conservative management fails) and the need for multidisciplinary planning (weight loss, PT, pain management, and surgical referral). The prescription of meloxicam also contributes to moderate risk management (pharmacologic treatment with potential adverse effects).\n- Medical necessity and plan: The patient has a chronic, progressively symptomatic degenerative spine disease with plan for PT, weight loss, pain management, and consideration of major spine surgery; this aligns with the typical orthopedic E/M level where there is a complex management plan and consideration of surgery, which supports 99214 rather than lower levels.\nOverall, the encounter demonstrates moderate complexity in MDM and a level consistent with 99214 when not time-based, in line with AMA guidelines for established patients.\n",
