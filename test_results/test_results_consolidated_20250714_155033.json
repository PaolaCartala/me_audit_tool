This has been problematic for the last several weeks at a pain level 3/10. She describes the pain gets worse throughout\nthe day. She has been taking Motrin 600 mg. Scribes pain directly at the site of the trochanter and also the lower lumbar L3-4-5 S1 and\nleft SI joint. No fall no trauma no fever no chills no systemic complaints. Burning paresthesias again of the L4 and L5 left-sided\n \nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\nPhysical examination left hip full range of motion. Tenderness over the lateral aspect of the greater trochanter. Leg lengths equivalent\nneurological grossly intact deep tendon reflexes motor sensory intact negative clonus negative Babinski. Pain tenderness left SI joint\npalpation pain limited range of motion 20% lower lumbar L3 to the sacrum. Mildly positive tensional signs left leg L4 and L5 dermatomal\npattern. Negative on the right.\n \nIMAGING / RADIOGRAPHS / STUDIES REVIEWED:\nRadiographic findings of the AP pelvis shows symmetrical right and left hip. SI joints mildly arthritic. No lytic or blastic lesion. No avascular\nnecrosis. 2 view of the left hip shows well-preserved joint space. No avascular necrosis no fracture.\nLumbar AP and lateral radiograph shows significant disc degeneration at the L3-4-5 S1. Pedicles are intact. No known fracture.\nSignificant narrowing noted most probable foramina L4 455 S1\n \nIMPRESSIONS:\nImpression at this time were dealing with lower lumbar involvement stenosis probable disc bulging causing L4 and L5 dermatomal pattern\nparesthesias left leg. Also radiating pain to the SI joint and down the left leg as described. Pain tenderness over the greater trochanter on\nthe left. Internal/external rotation of both hips are symmetric and full no findings of pain in the groin negative pincer signs. No evidence of\nany significant abnormality relative to the joint surface of the left hip.\n \nPLAN:\nPlan at this time is to proceed with an injection of the left hip greater trochanter for trochanteric bursitis. This was carried out with\nultrasound guided technique. This was with 2 cc of Kenalog guided directly to the site of the bursa and injection with an 18-gauge needle.\nThis is well-tolerated and sterile dressing was applied and again the ultrasound was utilized from lateral cross into the bursa\nPatient will also institute a course of anti-inflammatory agents starting with a Decadron Dosepak followed by Mobic 15 mg daily x 6\nweeks. Also we will write for gabapentin 300 mg p.o. daily x 6 weeks.\nContinue at this time with formal therapy lower lumbar 3 times a week over the next month. Patient will return at that time for review\npossible need for MRI if it still is more significant in terms of the findings. She has had past injections in her back years ago with good\nsuccess. At this time she may require similar findings of probable stenosis and facet arthrosis and foraminal narrowing.\nMoncrief, Bernice L 10/07/1943 #225440 \n6/26/25, 11:33 AM\n Page 1\n \n \nThis dictation was prepared using Dragon Medical voice recognition software.

There are findings consistent with progression/exacerbation (persistent paresthesias and pain despite prior management, worsening symptoms throughout the day), and multiple areas are affected (lower lumbar spine, SI joint, left hip). The plan includes therapeutic injection and escalation of pharmacologic therapy.\n- Data reviewed: The provider reviewed and interpreted in-office imaging studies (pelvis, left hip, lumbar AP/lateral), involving moderate amount and complexity of data. Past imaging, multiple studies, and careful radiographic assessment are documented.\n- Risk: Moderate risk is supported by performing a procedure (ultrasound-guided trochanteric bursa injection with corticosteroid), starting new prescription drug management with a Decadron Dosepak, Mobic, and gabapentin (all new or adjusted), and referral to formal therapy. Additionally, a potential need for MRI and future interventions is mentioned, further supporting moderate risk.\n\nThis encounter does not reach high-complexity MDM (99215) as there is no indication of an imminent threat to life or bodily function, no decision for major surgery or hospital admission, and data reviewed/interpreted, though extensive, does not meet the level of complexity for 99215.

Medical Decision Making (MDM) is moderate based on AMA 2025 guidelines as follows: \n\n- Problems Addressed: Patient has multiple, active musculoskeletal concerns (cervical pain, cervical spondylosis, radicular pain, disc herniation) with persistent functional limitation and ongoing, inadequately controlled pain. Chronic condition (cervical spondylosis/disc herniation) is not stable and continues to impact function/work and pain management.\n- Data Reviewed: Moderate complexity. Provider personally reviewed outside MRI, MAPS (Michigan Automated Prescription System report), intake forms, historical records/extensive documentation and clinical history (as stated in the note). \n- Risk: Moderate. The plan includes ongoing prescription pain management (Tylenol with codeine—narcotic, even if managed by PCP), discussion of injection therapy (though deferred by patient), consideration of continuing/changing medications, ongoing inability to work, and management planning for persistent pain. Prescription drug management is specifically cited under moderate risk in the 2025 AMA definitions.\n\nThe note does not specify total time, but MDM clearly meets moderate complexity (99214) based on multiple criteria. There is insufficient support for high complexity (99215) as there is no severity to suggest threat to life or bodily function, and no major surgery/hospitalization planned. Lower MDM levels (99213 or 99212) are not justified given the chronic, persistent nature of conditions, complexity of data reviewed, prescription management, and work/functional limitation discussion.",

Problems Addressed: The central problem is severe right shoulder arthritis with significant symptoms (pain, loss of motion, prior discussion of shoulder replacement). While his hips (with two prior replacements) are stable, the shoulder issue is not minor nor stable and patient is considering a major intervention (shoulder arthroplasty), which has been deferred due to concerns. The decision was made for intra- and extra-articular steroid injection under ultrasound, which is not a low-risk procedure.\n\n2. Data Reviewed/Analyzed: Imaging was declined by patient, so no external records or additional diagnostics were reviewed.\n\n3. Risk of Complications/Morbidity/Mortality: The risk is moderate—there is prescription drug management (Depo-Medrol injection), invasive procedure (US-guided joint injection), and ongoing consideration of possible major surgery. The patient’s significant comorbidities (bilateral hip replacements), fall risk evaluation (ambulates with cane), and ongoing symptoms support the complexity.\n\nWhile no formal time was documented, the moderate MDM is sufficient per the guidelines to support 99214.

It has been an extended period since his last follow-up visit.
