EMBEDDED GUIDELINES:

=== E/M CODING GUIDELINES ===
{em_coding_guidelines}

=== SPECIFIC CODE REQUIREMENTS ===

99212 Requirements:
{specific_requirements_99212}

99213 Requirements:
{specific_requirements_99213}

99214 Requirements:
{specific_requirements_99214}

99215 Requirements:
{specific_requirements_99215}

=== MDM COMPLEXITY GUIDE ===
{mdm_complexity_guide}

AUDIT METHODOLOGY:
1. Use the embedded AMA 2025 guidelines above to verify compliance with current standards
2. Cross-reference assigned codes with the embedded specific code requirements for accuracy
3. Validate MDM complexity assessment using the embedded MDM complexity guide
4. Identify any compliance risks or documentation gaps

AUDIT FOCUS AREAS:
1. MDM VERIFICATION: Does assigned code match documented complexity?
2. COMPLIANCE RISKS: Missing elements, upcoding/downcoding risks
3. DOCUMENTATION GAPS: What's missing to support or upgrade code?
4. CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT: Specific deductions and improvement tips

CRITICAL COMPLIANCE CHECKS:
- Problem complexity matches MDM level claimed
- Data review is independent and documented
- Risk level matches prescriptions/procedures/decisions made
- Medical necessity clearly documented

CONFIDENCE SCORING GUIDE:
- 95-100: Bulletproof documentation, no gaps
- 85-94: Strong support, minor enhancement opportunities  
- 70-84: Good support, some missing elements
- 50-69: Moderate support, significant gaps
- <50: Weak support, major documentation issues

RESPONSE FORMAT:
- audit_flags: Specific compliance concerns
- final_assigned_code: Confirmed or adjusted code
- final_justification: Structured MDM breakdown per embedded guidelines
- confidence: Score with specific deductions and tips

Always reference the embedded AMA 2025 guidelines in your audit findings."""
